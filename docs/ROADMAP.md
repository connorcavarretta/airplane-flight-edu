- [ ] Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Add skip-to-content links
- [ ] Provide text alternatives for visualizations
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver)
- [ ] Add focus indicators
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (touch interactions)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Performance testing (Lighthouse)

**Learning Focus**: Web accessibility, inclusive design, testing methodologies

**Deliverable**: WCAG compliant website that works for all users

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Features (Optional, Week 6+)
